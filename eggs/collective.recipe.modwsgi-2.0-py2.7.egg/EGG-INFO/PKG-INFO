Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ''collective.recipe.modwsgi'' is a `zc.buildout`_ recipe which creates
        a `paste.deploy`_ entry point for mod_wsgi_.
        
        It is very simple to use. This is a minimal ''buildout.cfg'' file
        which creates a WSGI script mod_python can use::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = mywsgiapp
        
            [mywsgiapp]
            recipe = collective.recipe.modwsgi
            eggs = mywsgiapp
            config-file = ${buildout:directory}/production.ini
        
        This will create a small python script in parts/mywsgiapp called
        ''wsgi'' which mod_wsgi can load. You can also use the optional
        ''extra-paths'' option to specify extra paths that are added to
        the python system path.
        
        The apache configuration for this buildout looks like this::
        
            WSGIScriptAlias /mysite /home/me/buildout/parts/mywsgiapp/wsgi
        
            <Directory /home/me/buildout>
                Order deny,allow
                Allow from all
            </Directory>
        
        If the python script must be accessed from somewhere else than the buildout
        parts folder, you can use the optional ''target'' option to tell the recipe
        where the script should be created.
        
        For instance, the configuration for the mywsgiapp part could look like this::
        
            [mywsgiapp]
            recipe = collective.recipe.modwsgi
            eggs = mywsgiapp
            target = /var/www/myapp.wsgi
            config-file = ${buildout:directory}/production.ini
        
        The recipe would then create the script at /var/www/myapp.wsgi.
        
        Note that the directory containing the target script must already exist on
        the filesystem prior to running the recipe and be writeable.
        
        The apache configuration for this buildout would then look like this::
        
            WSGIScriptAlias /mysite /var/www/myapp.wsgi
        
            <Directory /var/www>
                Order deny,allow
                Allow from all
            </Directory>
        
        This recipe does not fully install packages, which means that console scripts
        will not be created. If you need console scripts you can add a second
        buildout part which uses `z3c.recipe.scripts`_ to do a full install.
        
        Configuration files with multiple applications
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        It is possible to specify multiple applications or pipelines in a single
        configuration file. If you do this you can specify which application to
        run by using the ``app_name`` option. For example if your ini files looks
        like this::
        
            [app:my_app]
            use = egg:my_application
        
            [pipeline:production]
            pipeline = my_app
             
            [pipeline:devel]
            pipeline =
                egg:WebError#evalerror
            my_app
        
        This specifies two way to run the your application: a *production*
        configuration which runs the application directly, and a *devel*
        configuration which also runs the WebError interactive debugger to
        catch errors. To use the production pipeline in mod_wsgi supply
        the app_name parameter::
        
            [mywsgiapp]
            recipe = collective.recipe.modwsgi
            eggs = mywsgiapp
            app_name = production
            config-file = ${buildout:directory}/production.ini

        --------------------

          http://groups.google.com/group/pylons-discuss/browse_thread/thread/9b9add4529b3779c?pli=1
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.1 - April 20, 2009
        --------------------
        
        * Add an 'extra-paths' option, similar the the zc.recipe.egg one.
          [chrism]
        
        
        1.0 - October 16, 2008
        ----------------------
        
        * No changes.
          [wichert]
        
        
        
        1.0rc1 - June 30, 2008
        ----------------------
        
        * Update the generated wrapper to test if a path is already in sys.path
          before adding it. This prevents paths being duplicated in sys.path
          when mod_wsgi reloads the module.
          [wichert]
        
        
        
        1.0b3 - June 23, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        * Do not make the recipe a subclass of zc.recipe.egg.Eggs but
          use a local instance to determine the working set.
          [wichert]
        
        * Format the sys.path changes in the wrapper to make it more
          human readable. This is purely cosmetic to help with debugging.
          [wichert]
        
        * Also recreate the wsgi wrapper file when updating a buildout part.
          This is needed to get get changes to versions in the working set
          (such as different version pins) reflected in the wrapper.
          [wichert]
        
        
        
        1.0b2 - June 13, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        * Call the Eggs constructor as well: working_set() needs too many of the
          internal variables it sets for us to set them ourselves. This fixes
          the recipe breaking when using find-links in buildout.
          [wichert]
        
        
        
        1.0b1 - June 13, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        * Initial release
